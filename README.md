##  <b> THis is a Google Gemini-based Discord chatbot. </b>
### The chatbot offers two interaction options: 
* Quick Answers: For a fast response, prefix your questions with an exclamation mark ("!"). The bot will deliver concise answers.
* Multi-Turn Chat: Initiate a conversation for a deeper discussion by typing "!start." In this mode, the bot uses a higher temperature setting, potentially providing more elaborate responses. However, response length is limited for efficient multi-user service. Each user maintains a separate conversation history for a personalized experience. Messages are tagged with your username for clarity. To exit, type "!quit."
* In multi-turn chat mode, it will reply on every messages of yours, if you want the bot to skip, enter a prefix "#"
