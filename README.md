##  <b> THis is a Google Gemini-based Discord chatbot. </b>
### The chatbot offers two interaction options: 
* ##### Quick Answers: For a fast response, prefix your questions with an exclamation mark ("!"). The bot will deliver concise answers.
  
* ##### Multi-Turn Chat: Initiate a conversation for a deeper discussion by typing "!start." In this mode, the bot uses a higher temperature setting, potentially providing more creative responses. However, response length is limited for efficient multi-user service. Each user maintains a separate conversation history in the specific channel (channel where user had entered the start command) for a personalized experience. Messages are tagged with your username for clarity. To exit multi-turn mode, user can type "!quit." In multi-turn chat mode, the chatbot will reply every messages of user, so if the user want to skip, add the prefix "#".
